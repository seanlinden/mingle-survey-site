      <h2>Survey Abstract</h2>
      <p>Despite advances in understanding star formation in nearby normal galaxies, there is a lack a dedicated large survey of stellar birth clouds in extreme starburst environments. Low-redshift starbursts are primarily triggered in major galaxy mergers. During merger events, compressive tides and turbulence are theorized to be most impactful from first pericentric passage to just prior to final coalescence, fueling energetic star formation activity in the ISM with high molecular gas fractions and high specific star formation rates. This NSF proposal makes use of a ALMA Large Proposal 12-m Array CO(2-1) observations of 22 mid-stage luminous infrared galaxy mergers. With this data, the luminosity, mass, and kinematics of individual giant molecular clouds (~ 70 pc) will be measured across each LIRG. This, combined with HST measures of the star formation rate, enable the characterization of the physical processes which drive star formation and feedback in these dynamically evolving systems. This proposal will aid in completing the panchromatic legacy that multi-wavelength galaxy surveys such as PHANGs are delivering in the local Universe. Finally, the PIs will focus on bringing science and scientific discovery to a broad audience (a) by disseminating the scientific outcomes of this proposal to the public through national popular science and amateur astronomy magazine articles and (b) by creating a public blog which chronicles the lifecycle of a scientific project from science idea to final publication.</p>
